Downloads
=========

The mplayer2 team doesn't provide official builds of the software.
We recommend you to **build it yourself** from the current git HEAD or
download one of the **unofficial builds**.

Source code
-----------

There are two main alternatives to build the player. First is to use
system libraries for all dependencies. Since the FFmpeg/Libav versions
available on many Linux distributions are old, in many cases this will
either not produce an optimal result or will require extra manual work
to update the libraries first.

For this reason there exists a separate build helper repository that
first builds an up-to-date version of Libav libraries and libass and
then builds the player statically linked against those.

.. note::
    See :ref:`this FAQ entry <faq-1>` about interaction with existing MPlayer
    installations. See :ref:`this FAQ entry <faq-3>` if you are have problems
    using mplayer2 in combination with the SMPlayer GUI.

Unofficial builds
-----------------

Most of these builds are provided by third parties. The mplayer2 team is not
affiliated with them, but we list them here for your own convenience.

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Platform", ""

    "Windows", "`binaries by lachs0r <http://mplayer2.srsfckn.biz/>`_ (may contain untested extra functionality)"
    "Mac OS X", "`binaries by pigoz <http://code.google.com/p/mplayerosx-builds/>`_ (may contain untested extra functionality)"
    "Linux", "Provided through each distributionâ€™s package repositories."

.. warning::
    Packages provided by some Linux distributions are really old (2.0
    release). It is not recommended to use such an old version of
    mplayer2, and you should notify the distro maintainers to help
    getting this resolved.
