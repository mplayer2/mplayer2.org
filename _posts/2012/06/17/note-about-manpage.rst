.. title: Note about the manpage
.. author: Uoti Urpala

.. abstract

The manual page included with the sources is currently outdated.
The version on the website has newer content.

.. body

The documentation has been converted from nroff format (the "raw" format
used for Unix manual pages) to reStructuredText markup. However, the
manpage distributed with the sources is still the old version, and
is missing some content updates that have been applied to the new RST
version. The "Manual" section of the website has been generated from
the latest documentation and is more up to date.
